### Problems I face
 * User Authentication. Taking on this project, I did not know anything about user authentication and 
   JWT, so I end up spending more time searching about it and watching tutorials video about it. 
 * United Testing. Writing a united test for the methods and database to make sure they work was challenging. 
   At the time of writing this I have not written a united test for all the method yet, and I may not even write 
   a united test for all of them.
 * I also face many problem in the frontend side. But I will not talk about it because my objective for this application 
   focus on the backend.
### What I learn
 * Before taking on application like this, make sure to learn more about authentication and united testing first.
 * Be committed and do not give up. At time, I almost decided not to do the authentication and united test. But as of now 
   I can say that I am 30% confident about **Authentication**.
